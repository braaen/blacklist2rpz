# blacklist2rpz
Download a list of blacklists and outputs to a jinja2 template for creating an rpz zone.  This was influenced by the py-hole project (https://github.com/glenpp/py-hole), which was in turn influenced by pi-hole (https://pi-hole.net)

Install the python script in the bin directory somewhere local on your system (i.e. /usr/local/bin/), and the configuration files in the folder the script uses.  The default config directory is /etc/blacklist2rpz/
